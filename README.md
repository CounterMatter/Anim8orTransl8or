# Anim8or Transl8or
Anim8or Transl8or converts Anim8or (.an8) files into COLLADA (.dae) files.

(For more information on COLLADA, please visit https://www.khronos.org/collada/)

## Prerequisites
Anim8or Transl8or requires .NET Framework 4.0. It is most likely already installed on your system if you are using Windows XP or later. Otherwise, it can be installed from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851.

Anim8or Transl8or may also run on other operating systems using Mono (https://www.mono-project.com/), but this is not tested.

## Command-line
~~~
Anim8orTransl8or.Cli.exe input.an8 output.dae
~~~

## What's supported?
 * Parsing .an8 files generated by version 1.00 of Anim8or. There is a lot of missing information on the .an8 format (it was documented up to version 0.85 at the time of writing), so some files may fail to parse.
 * Parsing/generating .dae files that conform to version 1.4.1 of the spec.
 * .an8 "mesh" converts to .dae "polylist"
   * .an8 "points" convert to the .dae "VERTEX" semantic
   * .an8 "normals" convert to the .dae "NORMAL" semantic (see [caveat](#how-to-export-normals-from-anim8or))
   * .an8 "texcoords" convert to the .dae "TEXCOORD" semantic

## What's not supported yet?
 * .an8 "header"
 * .an8 "description"
 * .an8 "environment"
 * .an8 "texture"
 * .an8 "material"
 * .an8 "object" (everything exception for .an8 "mesh")
 * .an8 "figure"
 * .an8 "sequence"
 * .an8 "scene"
 * Graphical user interface. The command-line is available.
 * Configuration/optimization. Everything will be converted as faithfully as possible.
 * Error handling. The program will just crash if it does not like something.
 * Converting .dae to .an8. COLLADA supports many features that may not convert to Anim8or very easily.
 * Converting .an8 to other formats besides .dae. There are many converters from COLLADA to other formats, so this is the lowest priority.

## How to Export Normals from Anim8or
In order to support normals in the .dae file, it is currently required that Anim8or exports them. Anim8or will only export normals if Options->Debug->Output Normals is checked. You will have to resave the file after checking it.

## Report Problems
Anim8or Transl8or is very immature, and the .an8 format is not completely documented, so there will be problems and incompatibilities. Please enter issues on GitHub (https://github.com/Enumer8/Anim8orTransl8or/issues). Please don't enter issues about things that are [not supported yet](#what's-not-supported-yet). For the best chance at fixing the issue, please attach or link to the .an8 file that causes the problem.

## Contributing
Anim8or Transl8or is open source software. User contributions are appreciated. Please create a pull request on GitHub (https://github.com/Enumer8/Anim8orTransl8or/pulls). Please focus on developing things that are [not supported yet](#what's-not-supported-yet) and be sure to test your changes. Visual Studio 2017 is recommended for development.

## Change log
 * Anim8orTransl8or.Cli v0.1.0
